  <h2 class="page-title">About me</h2>
  <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Paul aka Skyper.</p>
<p>Self-educated since my childhood, I am a technology and science lover with a deep
passion for IT, information security and open-source software, and I am also obsessed
by automation. I write software, create learning content about IT-related topics
and hunt for bugs.</p>
<p>My curiosity led me to work in different areas such as robotics, academic research
and security engineering. I have never restricted myself to one specific topic,
which translates my vision that everything is interconnected and that there are many
ways to express our inner creativity. For this reason, I have always kept exploring
new horizons in my spare time, creating and contributing to open-source projects,
participating in technological and ecological groups, etc.</p>
<p>Sharing knowledge and experience is also something I am really attached to. This
is why I started this blog in 2011 as a first way to contribute back to the community
which allowed me to learn by myself. Since then, I continued creating content such
as articles in magazines, presentations, interactive tutorials and hacking challenges.
When I was working for Workday, I had the possibility to lead their global CTF hacking
competition. I took this opportunity to create something even bigger by organising
security workshops, monthly security quizzes and other innovative initiatives like
the Malware Caf√©, a pop-up coffee shop where people could come to see real-life hacking
techniques in action to demonstrate the dangers of public places (and to enjoy a
cup of coffee and some pastries of course!).</p>
<p>For many years, one after another, I worked for different companies, from startups
to big multinationals. It was a great way to diversify my experience but I then
decided to try something really different and challenging. This is how I became
independent professionally speaking. I can now fully use my time to help people
realise their projects, create even more content and focus on research.</p>
