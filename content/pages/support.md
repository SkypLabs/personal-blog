I've been working on many open-source software and other publicly-shared
resources for a long while now without asking any counterpart as I love what I'm
doing and I deeply think that good engineering is a matter of sharing and
exchanging with people. Also, security and privacy go hand-in-hand with
transparency and we definitely need more of it in our actual world.

Having said that, if you like my work and want to support me, tips are very
welcome :slightly_smiling_face:

### Brave Rewards

### Buy Me A Coffee

Coffee][buy-me-a-coffee] or [Ko-fi][ko-fi], you can be sure that I will
literally use your tips for this very purpose :coffee:
