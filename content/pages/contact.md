### Email 📧

Here is my email address: {{ mailto() }}

#### With PGP 🔐

If you have something confidential to share, please use [PGP][pgp]/[GPG][gpg]
encryption to secure our communication.

2. Encrypt the password with [this online tool][keybase-encrypt-tool]. Only me
   will be able to decrypt it.

4. I will answer you with a password-encrypted email via the [Tutanota
   webmail][tutanota].
