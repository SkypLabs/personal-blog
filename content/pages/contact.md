### Email :incoming_envelope:

Here is my email address: {{ mailto() }}

#### With PGP :closed_lock_with_key:

If you have something confidential to share, please use [PGP][openpgp]
encryption to secure our communication.

My public key can be downloaded from my [Keybase][keybase] profile:

{{ keybase_pgp_badge() }}

To facilitate the encryption process, you can use [this online
tool][keybase-encrypt-tool]. You can also use it to verify my signatures.

#### Without PGP :unlock:

If you want to email me securely but you don't know or don't want to use PGP,
please follow these steps:

1. Choose or generate a strong password.
2. Encrypt the password with [this online tool][keybase-encrypt-tool]. Only me
   will be able to decrypt it.
3. Copy the encrypted password and send it to me at {{ mailto() }}.
4. I will answer you with a password-protected end-to-end encrypted email via
   the [Tuta webmail][tuta].

### Keybase :key:

If you have a [Keybase][keybase] account, you can start chatting securely with
me by going on [my profile][my-keybase-profile].
