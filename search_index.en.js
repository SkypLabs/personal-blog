I have never restricted myself to one specific topic,\nwhich translates my vision that everything is interconnected and that there are many\nways to express our inner creativity. For this reason, I have always kept exploring\nnew horizons in my spare time, creating and contributing to open-source projects,\nparticipating in technological and ecological groups, etc.\nSharing knowledge and experience is also something I am really attached to. This\nis why I started this blog in 2011 as a first way to contribute back to the community\nwhich allowed me to learn by myself. Since then, I continued creating content such\nas articles in magazines, presentations, interactive tutorials and hacking challenges.\nWhen I was working for Workday, I had the possibility to lead their global CTF hacking\ncompetition. I took this opportunity to create something even bigger by organising\nsecurity workshops, monthly security quizzes and other innovative initiatives like\nthe Malware Café, a pop-up coffee shop where people could come to see real-life hacking\ntechniques in action to demonstrate the dangers of public places (and to enjoy a\ncup of coffee and some pastries of course!).\nFor many years, one after another, I worked for different companies, from startups\nto big multinationals. It was a great way to diversify my experience but I then\ndecided to try something really different and challenging. This is how I became\nindependent professionally speaking.

The choice\nof the sharing method mostly depends on the relationship of the related\ncomponents. Typically, within the context of a parent-child topology, the most\nstraightforward choice would be to use the @Input and @Output decorators.\nFor sibling components, relying on a data sharing service seems to be the most\nobvious solution. In any case, once you have settled on the choice of a\ncommunication topology, you need to decide which data propagating mechanism to\nuse.\nGenerally, components use EventEmmiter objects to share data with each other.\nWhen you pass data into an Angular component with an @Input decorator, you are\nactually using an EventEmitter object. Although this solution is appropriate\nfor the majority of situations, this is not always the case. Let's consider the\nfollowing example:\n\n\nAn emitter component fires an event when a certain situation happens using an\nEventEmitter object. The event is designed to be received by the two\nreceivers. These two components are independent from each other and they are\ncontrolled by a router which means that only one of them is executed at once.\nHowever, we want both receivers to be able to process the latest version of the\nshared data sent by the emitter component. The problem here is that the emitter\nsends its data only once as soon as the trigger event is fired. Only the active\nreceiver will receive the shared data.\nBelow is an interactive demo of this example:\n\nA sidebar component (the emitter) contains a drop-down menu with different value\nchoices. When a user selects one or more of these choices, the related values\nare sent to the currently displayed receiver (receiver 1 at start-up). The\ndisplayed receiver is nested inside a router component. Since only one of the\ncomponents controlled by the router is executed at once, the drop-down menu's\nvalues are not propagated when the user decides to display the second receiver\nby clicking on the second tab. Consequently, the user's input selection is lost,\neven when going back and forth from receiver 1 to receiver 2.\nAngular's sharing mechanisms rely on the ReactiveX library. The\nEventEmitter definition extends the ReactiveX library's\nSubject class:\n\nAs a result, any of the varieties of Subject is suitable to be used\ninstead of EventEmitter. For the present use case, a ReplaySubject object\nwith a buffer size of 1 seems to be a good solution to solve the issue\npreviously described. That way, the latest version of the shared data sent by\nthe emitter will be sent again each time a new receiver will subscribe to its\ndata stream:\n\nSee the result for yourself:\n\nAs you can see, the communication topology is not the only thing to think about\nwhen designing the software architecture of your Angular application. Take the\ntime to read about the different Subject classes from the ReactiveX\nlibrary before implementing your own homemade solution.\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/angular-sharing-mechanisms/","title":"[Angular] Different sharing mechanisms for different situations"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/angular-unit-tests-chromium-docker/":{"body":"Running unit tests for front-end web applications require them to be tested in a\nweb browser. While it's not an issue on a workstation, it can become tedious\nwhen running in a restricted environment such as a Docker container. In fact,\nthese execution environments are generally lightweight and do not contain any\ngraphical environment.\nOne solution to work around this issue is to use a headless web browser designed\nfor development purposes, like PhantomJS. While it's an elegant\nsolution for testing an application, it would be even better to test it directly\nin a web browser which will be used by the end-users in order to match real\nconditions of use, for examples Firefox or Chromium/Google Chrome. However, as\nmentioned above, it is needed to find a way to execute a regular web browser in\na restricted environment.\n\nThe main issue is that regular web browsers need a graphical environment to be\nexecuted. A widely used workaround is to rely on xvfb to provide \"an X\nserver that can run on machines with no display hardware and no physical input\ndevices\". While this method works well, it requires you to install additional\nsoftware on the restricted environment and the configuration can be a bit\ntricky. Thankfully for us, some web browsers designed for end-users now come\nwith a headless mode. This last one doesn't require any graphical rendering\nserver to work. Chromium/Google Chrome has already implemented this\nfeature while Mozilla is still working on\nit to add it to Firefox.\nSo, what are we waiting for? Let's create a testing environment in a Docker\ncontainer! For that purpose, the testing environment will rely on the official\nNode.js Docker image as base image and Chromium as web browser. I\nwill suppose that you have an Angular project bootstrapped with Angular\nCLI.\nChromium/Google Chrome is shipped with the headless mode since version 59. The\nofficial Node.js Docker image is based on Debian Jessie by default and to this\ndate, the latest version of Chromium in Debian Jessie's repositories is 57 since\nit is 59 for Debian Stretch. It is possible to use an official Node.js Docker\nimage based on Debian Stretch using the appropriate tag. In our case,\n8-stretch:\n\n    \n\nNow, it is needed to configure Karma to use Chromium with the headless mode. The\nkarma-chrome-launcher supports natively\nChromeHeadless as web browser. To define it as default web browser in\nkarma.conf.js:\n\nIt is now possible to build the Docker image and to use it to run the unit\ntests. Navigate to the folder containing the source code of your Angular project\nand the above Dockerfile, then:\n\nEverything should work well. However, on some continuous integration\nenvironments, the Chromium's sandbox feature can present a\nproblem. To fix it, add an additional web browser\ncalled ChromeHeadlessCI to the Karma configuration which will be based on\nChromeHeadless but with the --no-sandbox flag this time:\n\nAlso, increase the browser's no activity timeout to be sure that the continuous\nintegration pipeline doesn't fail because the duration value is too short:\n\nThe complete karma.conf.js should look like this:\n\n    \n\nFinally, add an npm script to run ng test using ChromeHeadlessCI and with\nthe --single-run=true option:\n\n    \n\nWith this done, it is now possible to run the continuous integration tests\ninside a Docker container:\n\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/angular-unit-tests-chromium-docker/","title":"[Angular] Running unit tests with Chromium in a Docker container"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/apache-edit-php-config/":{"body":"Traditionnellement, la configuration de PHP se définit dans le fichier\nphp.ini.

Cela se traduit par\nl'ajout de nouvelles règles Netfilter dans les chaînes INPUT et OUTPUT. Le\nsouci est que ces nouvelles règles viennent perturber le bon fonctionnement de\nDroidwall. Voyez par vous même :\n\nLa règle correspondante à Droiwall se situe après celle qui autorise l'ensemble\ndu trafic à sortir. Pour corriger ce problème, j'ai écrit un petit script de\nrègles Netfilter que je fais exécuter par Droidwall (via une de ses options)\npour modifier la position de la règle citée plus haut. Voici le script en\nquestion :\n\nAprès avoir copié ce petit script sur votre carte SD, il vous faut utiliser\nl'option \"Set Custom Script\" de Droidwall pour lui demander de l'exécuter à\nchacune de ses activations. Dans la zone de texte prévue à cet effet, il vous\nfaut écrire :\n\nEt voici le résultat en image :\n\nCette méthode permet de résoudre le problème mais je vais prendre le temps de\ncontacter le développeur de l'application Droidwall pour le lui signaler et\nainsi éviter toutes ces manipulations.\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/droidwall-issue-android-4/","title":"Problème d'utilisation de Droidwall depuis la version 4 d'Android"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/euler-angles-accelerometer/":{"body":"Les angles d'Euler sont 3 angles qui permettent de décrire l'orientation d'un\nobjet dans un espace tridimensionnel.\nSi nous prenons par exemple un objet quelconque, le centre de masse \\(m\\) de\ncet objet est une coordonnée dans notre espace à 3 dimensions. Tout point dans\nun espace à \\(n\\) dimensions peut être atteint par \\(n\\) translations.\nAinsi, le point \\(m\\) est atteint par 3 translations, quelque soit l'origine\ndu repère.\nDe façon semblable à une coordonnée, une orientation dans cet espace\ntridimensionnel est obtenue par trois rotations. Ces rotations sont effectuées\nsuccessivement dans un ordre arbitraire, chacune autour d'un des trois axes du\nrepère. Cela revient à effectuer une rotation dans le plan formé par deux axes\nautour d'un troisième, et cela trois fois de suite.\nNous allons ici chercher à démontrer qu'il est possible de calculer les angles\nd'Euler (et donc l'orientation de l'objet) en utilisant uniquement un\naccéléromètre triaxial (c'est à dire 3 accéléromètres 1 axe montés\northogonalement). Pour rappel, un accéléromètre permet de mesurer l'accélération\nlinéaire que subit un corps auquel ce capteur serait attaché.\nLa sortie de l'accéléromètre peut être modélisée de la façon suivante :\n\\[\n\\vec{a_{S}} =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} a_{Sx} \\\\ a_{Sy} \\\\ a_{Sz} \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\vec{a_{B}} + R_{I}^{B} \\vec{g}\n\\]\n\n\\(\\vec{a_{S}}\\) correspond à la sortie de l'accéléromètre. Elle est\nreprésentée par la somme de \\(\\vec{a_{B}}\\), l'accélération subie par le corps\nen mouvement sur lequel est accroché l'accéléromètre, et \\(\\vec{g}\\), la\ngravité terrestre. \\(R_{I}^{B}\\) est la matrice de rotation qui permet de\nprojeter \\(\\vec{g}\\) du référentiel inertiel terrestre au référentiel du corps\nen mouvement. Tous les vecteurs sont orientés selon la convention\nNorth-East-Down.\nLorsque \\(\\vec{a_{B}} = \\vec{0}\\) :\n\\[\n\\vec{a_{S}} =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} a_{Sx} \\\\ a_{Sy} \\\\ a_{Sz} \\end{array} \\right) =\nR_{I}^{B} \\vec{g} =\nR_{I}^{B} \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\nCela correspond à la situation dans laquelle le corps est au repos, c'est à dire\nqu'il ne subit aucune accélération. \\(\\vec{g} = (0,0,1)^{T} \\) correspond à\nune fois la valeur de la gravité terrestre sur l'axe \\(z\\) du repère Terre.\nNous allons maintenant chercher à résoudre cette équation. Regardons tout\nd'abord l'expression des matrices de rotation :\n\\[\nR_{x}(\\phi) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\cos(\\phi) &amp; sin(\\phi) \\\\ 0 &amp; -\\sin(\\phi) &amp; \\cos(\\phi) \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{y}(\\theta) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\cos(\\theta) &amp; 0 &amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) &amp; 0 &amp; \\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{z}(\\psi) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\cos(\\psi) &amp; \\sin(\\psi) &amp; 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\psi) &amp; \\cos(\\psi) &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\nChacune de ces matrices correspond à une rotation autour d'un des axes du\nrepère. Étant donné que nous voulons effectuer les trois rotations\nsuccessivement, nous devons multiplier les matrices entre elles. Or, la\nmultiplication de matrices n'est pas commutative. Nous devons choisir un ordre\narbitraire à ces multiplications.\nVoici le détail des calculs pour \\(R_{I}^{B} = R_{xyz}\\) :\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\vec{a_{S}} &amp;=\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} a_{Sx} \\\\ a_{Sy} \\\\ a_{Sz} \\end{array} \\right) =\nR_{xyz}\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\nR_{x}(\\phi)R_{y}(\\theta)R_{z}(\\psi) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\\\ &amp;=\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\cos(\\phi) &amp; \\sin(\\phi) \\\\ 0 &amp; -\\sin(\\phi) &amp; \\cos(\\phi) \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\cos(\\theta) &amp; 0 &amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) &amp; 0 &amp; \\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\cos(\\psi) &amp; \\sin(\\psi) &amp; 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\psi) &amp; \\cos(\\psi) &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\\\ &amp;=\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\cos(\\theta) &amp; 0 &amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta) &amp; \\cos(\\phi) &amp; \\sin(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta) &amp; -\\sin(\\phi) &amp; \\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\cos(\\psi) &amp; \\sin(\\psi) &amp; 0 \\\\ -\\sin(\\psi) &amp; \\cos(\\psi) &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\\\ &amp;=\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\psi) &amp; \\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\psi) &amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\psi)-\\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\psi) &amp; \\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\psi)+\\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\psi) &amp; \\sin(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\psi)+\\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\psi) &amp; \\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\psi)-\\sin(\\phi)\\cos(\\psi) &amp; \\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\\\ &amp;=\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSautons directement au résultat des cinq autres possibilités :\n\\[\nR_{y}(\\theta)R_{x}(\\phi)R_{z}(\\psi) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} -\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi) \\\\ \\sin(\\phi) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi) \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{x}(\\phi)R_{z}(\\psi)R_{y}(\\theta) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} -\\cos(\\psi)\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)+\\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\psi)\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta)-\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\psi) \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{y}(\\theta)R_{z}(\\psi)R_{x}(\\phi) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\psi)-\\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\psi)\\sin(\\phi) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)+\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\psi) \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{z}(\\psi)R_{x}(\\phi)R_{y}(\\theta) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\psi)-\\cos(\\psi)\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\psi)\\cos(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)+\\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\psi) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi) \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nR_{z}(\\psi)R_{y}(\\theta)R_{x}(\\phi) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\sin(\\phi)\\sin(\\psi)-\\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\psi)\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\psi)\\sin(\\phi)+\\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\psi)\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi) \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\nEn comparant les résultats, nous pouvons remarquer que dans les cas de\n\\(R_{xyz}\\) et de \\(R_{yxz}\\), les résultats ne dépendent que de \\(\\phi\\)\net \\(\\theta\\), ce qui va nous permettre de résoudre l'équation. En effet, les\nautres solutions ne sont pas exploitables.\nNous allons faire le choix arbitraire de  \\(R_{I}^{B} = R_{xyz}\\) pour la\nsuite :\n\\[\n\\vec{a_{S}} =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} a_{Sx} \\\\ a_{Sy} \\ a_{Sz} \\end{array} \\right) =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c} -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta) \\end{array} \\right)\n\\]\nAinsi, nous avons \\(a_{Sx} = -\\sin(\\theta)\\), \\(a_{Sy} =\n\\sin(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta)\\) et \\(a_{Sz} = \\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta)\\). Cela nous\npermet d'obtenir les expressions suivants :\n\\[\n\\frac{a_{Sy}}{a_{Sz}} =\n\\frac{\\sin(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\phi)\\cos(\\theta)} =\n\\tan(\\phi) \\Rightarrow \\phi =\n\\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{a_{Sy}}{a_{Sz}} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\na_{Sx} =\n-\\sin(\\theta) \\Rightarrow \\sin(\\theta) =\n-a_{Sx}\n\\]\n\\[\na_{Sy}^{2} + a_{Sz}^{2} =\n\\cos^{2}(\\theta) ; (\\sin^{2}(\\phi) + \\cos^{2}(\\phi)) =\n\\cos^{2}(\\theta) \\Rightarrow \\cos(\\theta) =\n\\sqrt{a_{Sy}^{2} + a_{Sz}^{2}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\tan(\\theta) =\n\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)} =\n\\frac{-a_{Sx}}{\\sqrt{a_{Sy}^{2} + a_{Sz}^{2}}} \\Rightarrow \\theta =\n\\tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{-a_{Sx}}{\\sqrt{a_{Sy}^{2} + a_{Sz}^{2}}} \\right)\n\\]\nNous sommes donc maintenant capable d'obtenir l'orientation de notre objet selon\ndeux degrés de liberté uniquement en regardant la sortie de son accéléromètre\nembarqué.

Then, I checked the known\nvulnerabilities of Adminer v4.6.2 (the version number is indicated on the login\npage) and it turned out that there is a way to read arbitrary files on the\nremote machine.\nThe attack takes place in 2 steps:\n\nInstead of trying to log in the local database of the remote system, an\nattacker can log in a public RDBMS they own.\nThen, the attacker can execute LOCAL INFILE SQL queries to read arbitrary\nfiles on the remote filesystem.\n\nBettercap has a module to set up a rogue MySQL\nserver to read files from the victim using the\ntechnique previously mentioned. To do so, I created a caplet\nscript with the following content:\n\nAnd to start Bettercap:\n\nBefore going further, make sure to accept incoming connections from the remote\nserver. If you are on a Linux-based system like myself, add this Netfilter rule\nwith iptables:\n\nTo start the attack, I just needed to ask Adminer to connect to my rogue server\nvia the login form. Since I used a fake MySQL server, I could enter any\nusername, password and database name I wanted. It worked well and I could\nretrieve the actual MySQL credentials used by the PHP application:\n\nAnd these credentials are the ones of an actual UNIX account!\n\nRoot flag\nAfter a bit of enumeration, I quickly realised that waldo had the permission\nto run /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh on behalf of root:\n\nWhen running this shell script, the user is prompted to select an admin task to\nexecute:\n\nAfter inspection of the source code, the only promising element I found for a\nprivilege escalation was the call to the Python script /opt/scripts/backup.py\n(belonging to root as well):\n\nThis backup tool imports the make_archive function from the shutil module to\ngenerate a gztar archive of the /var/www/html folder:\n\nIn Python, the folders where the interpreter looks for the modules you try to\nimport are listed in the PYTHONPATH environment variable, just\nlike PATH in a shell. Given that the SETENV option is set in the sudoers\npolicy module for the execution of /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh by waldo, the\nvalue of PYTHONPATH can be overwritten, allowing to inject custom versions of\nthe imported modules.\nIt is exactly the strategy I followed. I created another module named shutil\ncontaining my own implementation of make_archive:\n\nI placed this Python script in /tmp/shutil/__init__.py and then:\n\nThe root flag was cf943b5f4a33dc4b9a438550d232915f.\nWrapping up\nIt was an easy machine, as expected.

Une télécommande pour allumer la télévision, une autre pour\nallumer le home cinema... et plus on multiplie les appareils électroniques dans\nson salon, plus on collectionne de télécommandes !\nDans le but de me simplifier la vie, j'ai donc décidé de réaliser un montage\nélectronique pour pouvoir piloter mes appareils à infrarouge depuis un système\ninformatique classique, en particulier depuis mon téléphone portable. Je vais\ndonc détailler dans cet article les différentes étapes de la réalisation ainsi\nque les différents éléments permettant de reproduire à l'identique le système\nque j'ai développé.\n\nPour commencer, un petit aperçu de la réalisation s'impose. Les principaux\nappareils que je désirais pouvoir contrôler à distance depuis mon smartphone\nsont ma télévision et mon home cinema. Le principal obstacle à cela est qu'aucun\ntéléphone récent ne possède d'interface infrarouge. Il est donc impossible\nde faire communiquer le téléphone directement avec mon installation multimédia,\nd'où la réalisation d'un montage électronique qui servira d'intermédiaire. En\neffet, ce petit montage va jouer le rôle de \"proxy\", l'échange entre le\ntéléphone et ce dernier se faisant en Bluetooth. Ce choix m'est apparu\névident pour deux raisons simples. Premièrement, le Bluetooth est une\ntechnologie omniprésente qui est embarquée dans tous les smartphones qui se\nrespectent. Deuxièmement, un ami m'avait récemment offert un module Bluetooth et\nje ne m'en étais pas encore servi :)\nVoici donc la liste des éléments utilisés pour la réalisation complète :\n\nUn smartphone (Nexus S sous Android).\nUne carte Arduino (Uno).\nUn module Bluetooth (Sparkfun Bluetooth Mate Gold).\nUne diode à infrarouge émettrice (CQY 89).\nUne carte électronique conçue spécifiquement pour relier les différents\néléments entre eux.\n\nÀ la découverte du protocole NEC\nLe protocole de communication infrarouge utilisé par ma télévision et par mon\nhome cinema (tous deux de la marque Samsung) est celui développé par NEC. Il\nutilise des trames simples, composées d'une adresse codée sur 8 ou 16 bits selon\nla version du protocole ainsi que la commande à transmettre codée sur 8 bits. Le\nnombre maximum de commandes distinctes est donc de 256 par appareil. Pour coder\nles 1 et les 0 logiques, il utilise une impulsion haute de 560 µs suivie par une\nimpulsion basse d'une durée qui dépend du bit à transmettre. 560 µs pour un 0\nlogique ou 1.70 ms environ pour un 1 logique. Pour plus de détails, vous pouvez\nvous rendre sur cette page.\nPour mener à bien mon projet, j'avais besoin de récupérer l'adresse de mes\ndifférents appareils ainsi que le code des commandes à transmettre pour pouvoir\nles reproduire depuis mon montage électronique. Heureusement, j'ai la chance de\nposséder un récepteur infrarouge sur mon ordinateur portable. J'ai donc utilisé\nl'utilitaire mode2 du projet LIRC pour récupérer la durée des\nimpulsions générées par mes télécommandes et ainsi interpréter leur\nsignification. Pour accélérer ce travail rébarbatif, j'ai écrit très rapidement\nun petit script bash qui me retourne la valeur décimale de la commande contenue\ndans la trame :\n\n    \n\nAvec ce script, j'ai balayé l'ensemble des commandes utilisées par ma télévision\net mon home cinema. Par exemple, pour allumer ma télévision, la commande en\ndécimale est 153. À vous de faire pareil avec vos appareils !\nFaire le lien entre le bluetooth et l'infrarouge grâce à l'Arduino\nMaintenant que l'on connait comment le protocole NEC fonctionne, on peut\nl'implémenter dans la carte Arduino pour transmettre les commandes infrarouges.\nLa réception Bluetooth se fait via une liaison série entre le module Bluetooth\net la carte Arduino. Pour envoyer une commande via ce montage vers un appareil\ndistant utilisant l'infrarouge, il faut en premier lieu envoyer l'adresse du\ndestinataire puis la commande à proprement parler. Toutes ces informations\ndoivent être transmises en décimale octet par octet sous forme d'une chaîne de\ncaractères. Un octet est représenté par 3 caractères.\nPar exemple, pour allumer ma télévision, je dois envoyer la chaîne 007007153.\nCes 9 caractères représentent donc 3 octets. 007007 correspond aux 2 octets\nconstituant l'adresse de ma télévision et 153 à la commande d'allumage.\nVoici le code développé pour la carte Arduino (à compiler avec le SDK officiel)\n:\n\n    \n\nLe montage final\nPour relier les différentes parties du montage final entre elles, j'ai réalisé\nun shield Arduino grâce au logiciel de CAO EAGLE PCB Software. Le gros\navantage de cette solution est qu'il devient très facile de monter/démonter les\ndifférents composants de la réalisation étant donné que j'utilise des supports\npour toutes les connexions. Cela procure une certaine propreté du montage. En\nvoici une photo :\n\nVous trouverez l'archive ZIP contenant le PCB du sheild Arduino au format EPS à\ncette adresse.\nL'application Android\nPour terminer ma réalisation, j'ai développé une application Android pour\npouvoir piloter le tout depuis mon smartphone et/ou ma tablette. Ce programme\nnécessite un certain nombre d'améliorations (il s'agit principalement d'un PoC\net non pas d'un logiciel achevé) mais est parfaitement fonctionnel. Il a été\ntesté sur mon Nexus S et sur le Nexus One de ma copine.\nVous trouverez l'APK et le code source de l'application à cette\nadresse. Bien que développée pour n'être utilisée que pour\nma propre installation, vous pourrez vous en inspirer pour l'adapter à votre\nmatériel.\nConclusion\nLa réalisation de ce projet m'a permis de m'investir un peu plus dans le domaine\nde la domotique. En effet, l'intérêt premier n'est pas seulement de pouvoir\npiloter mes appareils à infrarouge depuis mon smartphone, mais depuis n'importe\nquel système informatique. En pratique, il est donc possible de perfectionner la\nréalisation en y rajoutant de la reconnaissance vocale, des tags RFID bien\nplacés dans l'appartement (mon Nexus S possède un lecteur NFC), etc.\nAffaire à suivre...\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/ir-remote-control-from-smartphone/","title":"Télécommander sa télévision et ses autres appareils à infrarouge depuis son smartphone"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/latex-on-mediawiki-1-19-2/":{"body":"Cela faisait plusieurs jours que j'essayais de faire fonctionner l'extension\nMath de MediaWiki pour pouvoir afficher des équations mathématiques en\nLaTeX.

As it is\nwritten on its official website, Scapy can replace a majority\nof network tools such as nmap, hping and tcpdump.\nOne of the features offered by Scapy is to sniff the network packets passing\nthrough a computer's NIC. Below is a small example:\n\n    \n\nThis little sniffer displays the source and the destination of all packets\nhaving an IP layer:\n\nIt will continue to sniff network packets until it receives a keyboard\ninterruption (CTRL+C).\n\nNow, let's look at a new example:\n\n    \n\nThis piece of code does exactly the same thing as the previous one except that\nthis time the sniff function is executed inside a dedicated thread. Everything\nworks well with this new version except when it comes to stopping the sniffer:\n\nWhen CTRL+C is pressed, a SIGTERM signal is sent to the process executing\nthe Python script, triggering its exit routine. However, as said in the\nofficial documentation about signals, only the main thread\nreceives signals:\n\nPython signal handlers are always executed in the main Python thread, even if\nthe signal was received in another thread.\n\nAs a result, when CTRL+C is pressed, only the main thread raises a\nKeyboardInterrupt exception. The sniffing thread will continue its infinite\nsniffing loop, blocking at the same time the call of sniffer.join().\nSo, how can the sniffing thread be stopped if not by signals? Let's have a look\nat this next example:\n\n    \n\nAs you may have noticed, we are now using the stop_filter parameter in the\nsniff function call. This parameter expects to receive a function which will\nbe called after each new packet to evaluate if the sniffer should continue its\njob or not. An Event object named stop_sniffer is used for that purpose. It\nis set to true when the join method is called to stop the thread.\nIs this the end of the story? Not really...\n\nOne side effect remains. Because the should_stop_sniffer method is called only\nonce after each new packet, if it returns false, the sniffer will continue its\njob, going back to its infinite sniffing loop. This is why the sniffer stopped\none packet ahead of the keyboard interruption.\nA solution would be to force the sniffing thread to stop. As explained in the\nofficial documentation about threading, it is possible to\nflag a thread as a daemon thread for that purpose:\n\nA thread can be flagged as a “daemon thread”. The significance of this flag is\nthat the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads are left. The\ninitial value is inherited from the creating thread. The flag can be set\nthrough the daemon property or the daemon constructor argument.\n\nHowever, even if this solution would work, the thread won't release the\nresources it might hold:\n\nDaemon threads are abruptly stopped at shutdown. Their resources (such as open\nfiles, database transactions, etc.) may not be released properly. If you want\nyour threads to stop gracefully, make them non-daemonic and use a suitable\nsignalling mechanism such as an Event.\n\nThe sniff function uses a socket which is released just before exiting, after\nthe sniffing loop:\n\nTherefore, the solution I suggest is to open the socket outside the sniff\nfunction and to give it to this last one as parameter. Consequently, it would be\npossible to force-stop the sniffing thread while closing its socket properly:\n\n    \n\nEt voilà! The sniffing thread now waits for 2 seconds after having received a\nkeyboard interrupt, letting the time to the sniff function to terminate its\njob by itself, after which the sniffing thread will be force-stopped and its\nsocket properly closed from the main thread.\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/python-sniffing-inside-thread/","title":"[Python] Sniffing inside a thread with Scapy"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/qubes-os-docker-storage/":{"body":"The Docker engine stores all image layers in /var/lib/docker by default, which\nis not compatible with Qubes OS' template system.

Ce salon étant réservé aux\nprofessionnels, on savait à quoi nous attendre. Cependant, il n'est pas rare de\nrencontrer des gens passionnés et vraiment intéressants dans ce genre d'endroit,\net c'était principalement le but de notre visite.\n\nC'est donc avec le plus grand des plaisirs qu'on est tombé sur Denis Boder,\nrédacteur en chef de GNU/Linux Magazine France et d'Open Silicium. Il se\ntenait sur un stand faisant la promotion d'Open Silicium qui, je le rappelle,\nest un magazine récemment lancé sur le thème de l'électronique embarquée et de\nl'open source. On a donc discuté avec lui pendant un certain temps sur divers\nsujets et il faut dire que c'est vraiment une personne très sympathique !\nLe reste de la journée, nous l'avons passé dans une salle de conférence, à\nécouter les différents intervenants partageant leurs expériences et leurs\nconnaissances au sujet de l'utilisation du noyau Linux dans les systèmes\nembarqués. Je ne peux pas dire qu'on en a réellement tiré quelque chose, les\nconférences visaient un public large donc pas vraiment de technique à l'horizon.\nCependant, l'ensemble a été instructif au niveau des retours d'expérience sur\nles phases de développement d'une solution embarquée utilisant Linux. Je suis\ncependant déçu ne pas avoir croisé Pierre Ficheux, car il était présent les\ndeux jours précédents notre visite du salon. Pour rappel, Pierre Ficheux est\nl'auteur de plusieurs articles dans le magazine GNU/Linux Magazine France et du\nseul livre traitant du noyau Linux sur les systèmes embarqués en Français.\nPour conclure ce petit compte rendu, voici une petite série de photos prises au\nsalon le jour même :\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/rts-embedded-systems-2011/","title":"Salon RTS Embedded Systems 2011"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/ruby-failed-to-build-gem-native-extension/":{"body":"Si vous obtenez ce message d'erreur lors de la première utilisation de l'outil\ngem, c'est qu'il vous manque certaines dépendances nécessaires à la création\nde la gem native extension.\nPour les installer sous Fedora :\n\nAprès cela, vous pouvez relancer l'installation de votre gem en utilisant\nl'option --use-system-libraries permettant d'utiliser les bibliothèques du\nsystème (ici, libxml2 et libxslt).\nPar exemple, pour installer la gem gollum :\n\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/ruby-failed-to-build-gem-native-extension/","title":"[Ruby] \"Failed to build gem native extension\""},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/sniff-network-wireshark-no-root/":{"body":"Wireshark est un outil d'analyse qui permet de \"sniffer\" les informations qui\npassent à travers les interfaces réseau du système sur lequel il est installé.\nIl est très utilisé car c'est un logiciel complet, multiplateforme et libre.

C'est un salon consacré à\ntout l'univers du libre dans le monde professionnel.\nPour ne pas changer mes habitudes, je m'y suis rendu une fois de plus le jeudi,\naccompagné du même et fidèle compagnon que la dernière fois pour le salon RTS\nEmbedded Systems. On ne change pas une équipe qui gagne !\n\nLe premier stand visible depuis l'entrée du salon était celui de Microsoft.\nComme par hasard ! Pour rappel, Microsoft était un des \"Gold Sponsors\" de\nl'événement et ce n'est pas la première fois que la firme de Redmond est\nprésente sur ce salon. On peut d'ailleurs dire qu'ils essayent de plus en plus\nde se rapprocher des acteurs de l'open source, comme en témoigne cet\narticle. Malheureusement pour eux, ils n'arrivent pas\nencore à convaincre beaucoup de monde. La preuve en image :\n\nOn peut également souligner le fait que leur stand était quasiment vide\ncontrairement à l'année dernière. Il n'y avait qu'une seule personne du staff\nquand on est passés devant, aucun visiteur et surtout rien à voir ! L'année\ndernière pourtant, il y avait bien Microsoft Surface en libre accès par exemple,\nmais cette fois-ci rien. Plus d'argent depuis le rachat de Skype ?\nEn continuant de se balader dans les allées du hall, nous sommes tombés sur le\nstand de Zodiac Aerospace qui présentait une de leurs solutions appelée\nSiT qui a pour but de fournir une plateforme multimédia pour les passagers\nd'avions de ligne. C'est un système dit \"Seat-Centric\", c'est à dire que tout\nest contenu dans le siège (l'OS, mais aussi les médias). L'intérêt d'une telle\nsolution est de proposer un système d'une très grande réactivité comparé aux\narchitectures centralisées actuellement utilisées dans les avions de ligne.\nEn effet, les architectures centralisées peuvent se retrouver avec des accès\nconcurrents introduisant une latence forte, voire une indisponibilité du\nservice, sans compter que cela nécessite d'embarquer plusieurs dizaines de kilos\nde matériel dans la soute. Avec une solution Seat-Centric, il suffit que la\ncompagnie aérienne \"push\" les nouveaux médias sur les disques dur des\nplateformes multimédia lorsqu'elle veut renouveler son catalogue. Chaque\npassager à donc l'équivalent d'un PC devant lui.\nVoici une petite vidéo de test de SiT en pleine action :\n\n    \n\nLe système fonctionne sur une Debian allégée avec du VLC / MPD / EFL / WebKit\ncomme technologies/logiciels sous-jacents. Le moins que l'on puisse dire est que\nc'est d'une grande fluidité et que l'interface est vraiment bien réalisée, Bravo\n!\nPendant la suite de notre visite, nous avons eu l'occasion de parler avec une\nmultitude de personnes sur les différents stands. Je peux par exemple citer les\nmembres du stand de l'April (association francophone de défense et de promotion\ndes logiciels libres), de Asterisk France (association des utilisateurs\nfrancophones d'asterisk visant l'entraide et la mise en relation d'acteurs\nprofessionnels), de \"Les Mongueurs de Perl\" (association française faisant la\npromotion du langage Perl), ou encore ceux du projet GNOME (un environnement de\nbureau libre). Ce genre d'échanges est vraiment des plus enrichissant. Cela\npermet d'avoir un contact direct avec les membres d'une communauté, d'en\napprendre plus sur leur cause et d'échanger des idées et des points de vue.\nLa plupart des grandes distributions avaient également leur stand : Red Hat,\nDebian, Ubuntu, Fedora, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, ... sans oublier SlitaZ ! (à\nessayer absolument pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas).\nJ'en profite pour vous parler d'une nouvelle distribution que je ne connaissais\npas, il s'agit de Mageia. C'est un fork de la distribution Mandriva Linux\ncrée le 18 septembre 2010 par des anciens employés du groupe Mandriva et de\nmembres de la communauté. L'objectif de ce fork est de ne plus être dépendant\ndes fluctuations économiques et des changements stratégiques de la société.\nD'après ce que l'on peut lire sur Wikipédia, \"Cette scission est due à de\nnombreuses incertitudes sur l'avenir du projet initial, une communication\ndécevante et des erreurs commerciales constatées\".\nVoici une photo du stand de Mageia :\n\nJe termine ce résumé en disant qu'on a bien profité lors de ce salon, que ce\nsoit par la découverte de nouveaux projets dans le monde des logiciels libres\nmais aussi grâce aux différentes rencontres et contacts avec les communautés\nprésentes.\nÀ l'année prochaine !\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/solutions-linux-open-source-2011/","title":"Salon des solutions Linux / Open Source 2011"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/stop-bash-from-writing-command-history/":{"body":"Edit : Une autre solution beaucoup plus propre m'a été proposée pour\nréaliser exactement la même chose :\n\nAprès ceci, l'écriture de l'historique des commandes par Bash aura lieu dans\n/dev/null, ce qui revient à écrire dans le vide.\n\nComme vous devez le savoir, le shell Bash conserve un historique des dernières\ncommandes que l'utilisateur a entré dans son terminal. Cela permet de garder une\ntrace de ce qui a été fait, chose particulièrement importante sur un serveur,\nsurtout si plusieurs personnes travaillent sur la même machine avec le même\ncompte. La liste des commandes est stockée par défaut dans le fichier\n~/.bash_history et il est possible d'afficher cette liste avec la commande\nhistory.\n\nCependant, il peut arriver de ne pas vouloir que Bash enregistre les dernières\ncommandes tapées dans l'historique, par exemple dans le cas où l'on a entré son\nmot de passe en clair sans prendre garde à ce que l'on faisait. Étant donné que\nBash ne met à jour le fichier ~/.bash_history qu'au moment de sa fermeture, la\nsolution est de forcer l'arrêt de son processus avant qu'il ne puisse le faire :\n\n$$ est un alias pour le PID du processus courant, à savoir Bash. Cette\ncommande va donc envoyer un signal SIGKILL au processus courant de Bash,\nl'empêchant de mettre à jour l'historique des commandes. Cependant, il ne faut\npas faire appel à la commande history entre temps car elle met à jour le fichier\n~/.bash_history avant de l'afficher.\nAttention bien sûr à ne pas abuser de cette méthode.

Le ITG-3200 est pourtant vendu\ncomme étant un gyroscope, mais en regardant sa datasheet, on s'aperçoit qu'il\nretourne une mesure en °/s. C'est une erreur très commune donc prenez garde la\nprochaine fois que vous sélectionnerez un produit de la sorte.\n\nLa ATAVRSBIN1 possède également une boussole électronique à effet de Hall\n(AK8975). Cette dernière ne repose donc pas sur le principe d'inertie et n'est\npar conséquent pas un capteur inertiel contrairement à l'intitulé du produit.\nUne autre petite subtilité : les circuits ITG-3200 et BMA-150, en plus de faire\noffice respectivement de gyromètre et d’accéléromètre, embarquent également un\ncapteur de température.\nTous les circuits cités plus haut utilisent un bus I²C pour\ns'interconnecter avec d'autres systèmes électroniques.\nEnfin, la carte est disponible chez Farnell.\nMontage de test\nPour ce test, j'ai utilisé une carte microcontrôleur Arduino Uno (rev3) afin de\nlire les valeurs renvoyées par les différents capteurs au moyen d'une liaison\nI²C. Le câblage est le suivant :\n\nCommunication I²C avec les capteurs\nLa datasheet de la carte ATAVRSBIN1 nous donne les\nadresses I²C suivantes :\n\nAK8975 : 0x0C\nBMA-150 : 0x38\nITG-3200 : 0x68\n\nCôté logiciel, j'ai utilisé la bibliothèque Wire du projet Arduino.\nExemple avec le gyromètre ITG-3200\nPlusieurs bibliothèques pour Arduino sont disponibles afin de\ncommuniquer avec les différents circuits de la carte ATAVRSBIN1. Je ne vais donc\npas réinventer la roue mais plutôt donner un exemple à titre pédagogique sur\ncomment établir la communication I²C afin de récupérer les valeurs qui nous\nintéressent. Pour cela, j'ai choisi de me concentrer sur le gyromètre ITG-3200.\nLes registres internes contenant les valeurs retournées par les capteurs sont\ndonnées dans la datasheet sous forme du tableau suivant :\n\nChaque capteur retourne une valeur sur 16 bits codée en code complément à 2.\nÉtant donné que la lecture se fait octet par octet sur un bus I²C, il sera\nnécessaire d'utiliser des décalages par 8 pour reconstituer nos valeurs sur 16\nbits.\nNous allons récupérer l'ensemble de ces valeurs d'un seul coup en lisant 8\noctets à partir de l'adresse du premier registre, à savoir 0x1B. La séquence de\n\"burst read\" utilisée pour lire plusieurs octets en une seule interrogation I²C\nest la suivante :\n\nUne fois les valeurs récupérées, il sera nécessaire d'effectuer quelques\nopérations mathématiques afin d'obtenir des unités lisibles, à savoir des °C\npour le capteur de température et des degrés par seconde pour les trois axes du\ngyromètre.\nEnfin, voici le code utilisé pour cet exemple :\n\n    \n\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/test-atmel-atavrsbin1/","title":"Test de la carte de développement à capteurs inertiels ATAVRSBIN1 d'Atmel"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/update-grub-from-live-cdusb/":{"body":"Sur toutes les machines dont je dispose à mon domicile, je n'ai installé Windows\nque sur une seule d'entre elles en multiboot avec Ubuntu (et oui, il faut avouer\nqu'avoir un Windows sous la main est toujours utile malgré tout).

Of course, not all of these\nproviders are equal in terms of quality of service, security or privacy. At the\ncontrary, some of them falsely claim to have a zero-log policy or to even\nprotect you from malicious actors.\nHaving said that, using a public VPN service is not necessarily a bad idea if\nyou choose it correctly. It's a matter of trust after all. Who do you trust the\nmost for keeping your traffic private, your ISP, or a carefully selected VPN\nprovider? (I said carefully here because you have a larger number of VPN\nproviders on the market than ISPs available where you live).\nIf you trust your VPN provider, you get in theory a higher degree of online\nprivacy by proxying your connections through it (even if, as of today, nothing\ncan fully replace Tor). But what about security? From a theoretical\nstandpoint once again, TLS is well enough to guarantee the security of your\nonline activity. And thanks to projects like Let's Encrypt, most\nwebsites are accessible via HTTPS these days.\n\nSo, using a VPN doesn't give you a better security? Well, in practice, it's not\nthat simple, and for one simple reason: there are lots of misconfigured web\nservers out there! And it is actually the reason I wanted to write this blog\npost. To be more precise, it is this Twitter\nthread which made\nme realise that even experienced information security people can miss this\npoint:\n\n\"Please stop with your misinformation campaign. VPNs are completely\nunnecessary to protect someone in this scenario, https works just fine.\"\n@SchmiegSophie\n\nSophie is right here, HTTPS works fine, but only when properly configured. As a\nmatter of fact, I use an online accounting web application called\nBullet for the needs of my company. When I try to log\ninto my Bullet account, here is what happens:\n\nAs you can see, I am redirected to an HTTP page, leaking the session cookie\nbecause it is not marked as Secure. I let the company\nknow about this security issue months ago but to this date, they still haven't\ntaken any actions to fix it, hence the public disclosure here.\nThis category of issues is unfortunately quite common. Just the other day, the\nsame thing happened to me once again on the Help Desk tool of a cloud provider\nspecialised in Healthcare Data Solutions (HDS). It goes without saying that\nimpersonating an account used to request actions on production systems is\nsomething not desired... If I were to be connected to a public Wi-Fi while\ntriggering one of those improper HTTP redirects, a malicious actor on the same\nnetwork could have stolen my session token, and indeed, tunnelling my network\ntraffic using a VPN is a way to prevent it.\nAnother less costly way to prevent your browser from leaking personal data,\nincluding session cookies, is to turn on the HTTPS-only mode of your web browser\nas I did with Firefox. The result is the one of the above\nscreenshot: Firefox warns you when plaintext data is about to be sent.\nTo conclude, the decision to use or not a VPN is yours, and my intention was\nsolely to help you weight the pros and cons on that matter. If you think a VPN\ncan fit your needs, I recommend Mullvad VPN (this is my personal\nopinion, not a sponsor) for the following main reasons: EU-based company,\ndiskless infrastructure, post-quantum\ncryptography, open-source software without trackers (and\nwritten in Rust!), supporting open-source projects such as Qubes\nOS, and transparent security audit\nreports.\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/vpn-security-improper-http-redirects/","title":"VPN, Security and Improper HTTP Redirects"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/publications/":{"body":"Blog Posts\n\n\"Parsing .DS_Store files with ZAP\", ZAP Blog, Sep. 08, 2023.\n\"How to use Git in a secure way\", Avatao Blog, Sep. 04,\n2018.
