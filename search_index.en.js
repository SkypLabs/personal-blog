automation. I write software, create learning content about IT-related topics\nand hunt for bugs.\nMy curiosity led me to work in different areas such as robotics, academic research\nand security engineering. I have never restricted myself to one specific topic,\nwhich translates my vision that everything is interconnected and that there are many\nways to express our inner creativity. For this reason, I have always kept exploring\nnew horizons in my spare time, creating and contributing to open-source projects,\nparticipating in technological and ecological groups, etc.\nSharing knowledge and experience is also something I am really attached to. This\nis why I started this blog in 2011 as a first way to contribute back to the community\nwhich allowed me to learn by myself. Since then, I continued creating content such\nas articles in magazines, presentations, interactive tutorials and hacking challenges.\nWhen I was working for Workday, I had the possibility to lead their global CTF hacking\ncompetition. I took this opportunity to create something even bigger by organising\nsecurity workshops, monthly security quizzes and other innovative initiatives like\nthe Malware CafÃ©, a pop-up coffee shop where people could come to see real-life hacking\ntechniques in action to demonstrate the dangers of public places (and to enjoy a\ncup of coffee and some pastries of course!).\nFor many years, one after another, I worked for different companies, from startups\nto big multinationals. It was a great way to diversify my experience but I then\ndecided to try something really different and challenging. This is how I became\nindependent professionally speaking.

The choice\nof the sharing method mostly depends on the relationship of the related\ncomponents. Typically, within the context of a parent-child topology, the most\nstraightforward choice would be to use the @Input and @Output decorators.\nFor sibling components, relying on a data sharing service seems to be the most\nobvious solution. In any case, once you have settled on the choice of a\ncommunication topology, you need to decide which data propagating mechanism to\nuse.\nGenerally, components use EventEmmiter objects to share data with each other.\nWhen you pass data into an Angular component with an @Input decorator, you are\nactually using an EventEmitter object. Although this solution is appropriate\nfor the majority of situations, this is not always the case. Let's consider the\nfollowing example:\n\n\nAn emitter component fires an event when a certain situation happens using an\nEventEmitter object. The event is designed to be received by the two\nreceivers. These two components are independent from each other and they are\ncontrolled by a router which means that only one of them is executed at once.\nHowever, we want both receivers to be able to process the latest version of the\nshared data sent by the emitter component. The problem here is that the emitter\nsends its data only once as soon as the trigger event is fired. Only the active\nreceiver will receive the shared data.\nBelow is an interactive demo of this example:\n\nA sidebar component (the emitter) contains a drop-down menu with different value\nchoices. When a user selects one or more of these choices, the related values\nare sent to the currently displayed receiver (receiver 1 at start-up). The\ndisplayed receiver is nested inside a router component. Since only one of the\ncomponents controlled by the router is executed at once, the drop-down menu's\nvalues are not propagated when the user decides to display the second receiver\nby clicking on the second tab. Consequently, the user's input selection is lost,\neven when going back and forth from receiver 1 to receiver 2.\nAngular's sharing mechanisms rely on the ReactiveX library. The\nEventEmitter definition extends the ReactiveX library's\nSubject class:\n\nAs a result, any of the varieties of Subject is suitable to be used\ninstead of EventEmitter.

While it's not an issue on a workstation, it can become tedious\nwhen running in a restricted environment such as a Docker container. In fact,\nthese execution environments are generally lightweight and do not contain any\ngraphical environment.\nOne solution to work around this issue is to use a headless web browser designed\nfor development purposes, like PhantomJS. While it's an elegant\nsolution for testing an application, it would be even better to test it directly\nin a web browser which will be used by the end-users in order to match real\nconditions of use, for examples Firefox or Chromium/Google Chrome. However, as\nmentioned above, it is needed to find a way to execute a regular web browser in\na restricted environment.\n\nThe main issue is that regular web browsers need a graphical environment to be\nexecuted. A widely used workaround is to rely on xvfb to provide \"an X\nserver that can run on machines with no display hardware and no physical input\ndevices\". While this method works well, it requires you to install additional\nsoftware on the restricted environment and the configuration can be a bit\ntricky. Thankfully for us, some web browsers designed for end-users now come\nwith a headless mode. This last one doesn't require any graphical rendering\nserver to work. Chromium/Google Chrome has already implemented this\nfeature while Mozilla is still working on\nit to add it to Firefox.\nSo, what are we waiting for? Let's create a testing environment in a Docker\ncontainer! For that purpose, the testing environment will rely on the official\nNode.js Docker image as base image and Chromium as web browser. I\nwill suppose that you have an Angular project bootstrapped with Angular\nCLI.\nChromium/Google Chrome is shipped with the headless mode since version 59. The\nofficial Node.js Docker image is based on Debian Jessie by default and to this\ndate, the latest version of Chromium in Debian Jessie's repositories is 57 since\nit is 59 for Debian Stretch. It is possible to use an official Node.js Docker\nimage based on Debian Stretch using the appropriate tag. In our case,\n8-stretch:\n\n    \n\nNow, it is needed to configure Karma to use Chromium with the headless mode. The\nkarma-chrome-launcher supports natively\nChromeHeadless as web browser. To define it as default web browser in\nkarma.conf.js:\n\nIt is now possible to build the Docker image and to use it to run the unit\ntests. Navigate to the folder containing the source code of your Angular project\nand the above Dockerfile, then:\n\nEverything should work well. However, on some continuous integration\nenvironments, the Chromium's sandbox feature can present a\nproblem. To fix it, add an additional web browser\ncalled ChromeHeadlessCI to the Karma configuration which will be based on\nChromeHeadless but with the --no-sandbox flag this time:\n\nAlso, increase the browser's no activity timeout to be sure that the continuous\nintegration pipeline doesn't fail because the duration value is too short:\n\nThe complete karma.conf.js should look like this:\n\n    \n\nFinally, add an npm script to run ng test using ChromeHeadlessCI and with\nthe --single-run=true option:\n\n    \n\nWith this done, it is now possible to run the continuous integration tests\ninside a Docker container:\n\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/angular-unit-tests-chromium-docker/","title":"[Angular] Running unit tests with Chromium in a Docker container"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/apache-edit-php-config/":{"body":"Traditionnellement, la configuration de PHP se dÃ©finit dans le fichier\nphp.ini.

Tout point dans\nun espace Ã  \\(n\\) dimensions peut Ãªtre atteint par \\(n\\) translations.\nAinsi, le point \\(m\\) est atteint par 3 translations, quelque soit l'origine\ndu repÃ¨re.\nDe faÃ§on semblable Ã  une coordonnÃ©e, une orientation dans cet espace\ntridimensionnel est obtenue par trois rotations. Ces rotations sont effectuÃ©es\nsuccessivement dans un ordre arbitraire, chacune autour d'un des trois axes du\nrepÃ¨re. Cela revient Ã  effectuer une rotation dans le plan formÃ© par deux axes\nautour d'un troisiÃ¨me, et cela trois fois de suite.\nNous allons ici chercher Ã  dÃ©montrer qu'il est possible de calculer les angles\nd'Euler (et donc l'orientation de l'objet) en utilisant uniquement un\naccÃ©lÃ©romÃ¨tre triaxial (c'est Ã  dire 3 accÃ©lÃ©romÃ¨tres 1 axe montÃ©s\northogonalement).

Then, I tried with a few\ncombinations of filenames around the concepts of \"contacts\" and \"credentials\",\nand the result didn't take long to come. I found the two files the above comment\nwas referring to: /admin-dir/contacts.txt and /admin-dir/credentials.txt.\nThe first one contains a list of email addresses with the first name and role of\nthe persons as comments:\n\nAnd the second one some credentials for different services:\n\nWith the FTP credentials, I could download these 2 files from vsftpd:\n\nhtml.tar.gz\ndump.sql\n\nThe SQL backup doesn't contain anything interesting but html.tar.gz reveals\nthe website structure:\n\nThe structure of the backup is almost the same as the one of the live website.\nOnly w4ld0s_s3cr3t_d1r has a different name (admin-dir on the live website).\nAfter inspection, I found a couple of credentials in different files.

Then, I checked the known\nvulnerabilities of Adminer v4.6.2 (the version number is indicated on the login\npage) and it turned out that there is a way to read arbitrary files on the\nremote machine.\nThe attack takes place in 2 steps:\n\nInstead of trying to log in the local database of the remote system, an\nattacker can log in a public RDBMS they own.\nThen, the attacker can execute LOCAL INFILE SQL queries to read arbitrary\nfiles on the remote filesystem.\n\nBettercap has a module to set up a rogue MySQL\nserver to read files from the victim using the\ntechnique previously mentioned. To do so, I created a caplet\nscript with the following content:\n\nAnd to start Bettercap:\n\nBefore going further, make sure to accept incoming connections from the remote\nserver. If you are on a Linux-based system like myself, add this Netfilter rule\nwith iptables:\n\nTo start the attack, I just needed to ask Adminer to connect to my rogue server\nvia the login form. Since I used a fake MySQL server, I could enter any\nusername, password and database name I wanted. It worked well and I could\nretrieve the actual MySQL credentials used by the PHP application:\n\nAnd these credentials are the ones of an actual UNIX account!\n\nRoot flag\nAfter a bit of enumeration, I quickly realised that waldo had the permission\nto run /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh on behalf of root:\n\nWhen running this shell script, the user is prompted to select an admin task to\nexecute:\n\nAfter inspection of the source code, the only promising element I found for a\nprivilege escalation was the call to the Python script /opt/scripts/backup.py\n(belonging to root as well):\n\nThis backup tool imports the make_archive function from the shutil module to\ngenerate a gztar archive of the /var/www/html folder:\n\nIn Python, the folders where the interpreter looks for the modules you try to\nimport are listed in the PYTHONPATH environment variable, just\nlike PATH in a shell. Given that the SETENV option is set in the sudoers\npolicy module for the execution of /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh by waldo, the\nvalue of PYTHONPATH can be overwritten, allowing to inject custom versions of\nthe imported modules.\nIt is exactly the strategy I followed. I created another module named shutil\ncontaining my own implementation of make_archive:\n\nI placed this Python script in /tmp/shutil/__init__.py and then:\n\nThe root flag was cf943b5f4a33dc4b9a438550d232915f.\nWrapping up\nIt was an easy machine, as expected.

Une tÃ©lÃ©commande pour allumer la tÃ©lÃ©vision, une autre pour\nallumer le home cinema... et plus on multiplie les appareils Ã©lectroniques dans\nson salon, plus on collectionne de tÃ©lÃ©commandes !\nDans le but de me simplifier la vie, j'ai donc dÃ©cidÃ© de rÃ©aliser un montage\nÃ©lectronique pour pouvoir piloter mes appareils Ã  infrarouge depuis un systÃ¨me\ninformatique classique, en particulier depuis mon tÃ©lÃ©phone portable. Je vais\ndonc dÃ©tailler dans cet article les diffÃ©rentes Ã©tapes de la rÃ©alisation ainsi\nque les diffÃ©rents Ã©lÃ©ments permettant de reproduire Ã  l'identique le systÃ¨me\nque j'ai dÃ©veloppÃ©.\n\nPour commencer, un petit aperÃ§u de la rÃ©alisation s'impose. Les principaux\nappareils que je dÃ©sirais pouvoir contrÃ´ler Ã  distance depuis mon smartphone\nsont ma tÃ©lÃ©vision et mon home cinema. Le principal obstacle Ã  cela est qu'aucun\ntÃ©lÃ©phone rÃ©cent ne possÃ¨de d'interface infrarouge. Il est donc impossible\nde faire communiquer le tÃ©lÃ©phone directement avec mon installation multimÃ©dia,\nd'oÃ¹ la rÃ©alisation d'un montage Ã©lectronique qui servira d'intermÃ©diaire. En\neffet, ce petit montage va jouer le rÃ´le de \"proxy\", l'Ã©change entre le\ntÃ©lÃ©phone et ce dernier se faisant en Bluetooth. Ce choix m'est apparu\nÃ©vident pour deux raisons simples. PremiÃ¨rement, le Bluetooth est une\ntechnologie omniprÃ©sente qui est embarquÃ©e dans tous les smartphones qui se\nrespectent. DeuxiÃ¨mement, un ami m'avait rÃ©cemment offert un module Bluetooth et\nje ne m'en Ã©tais pas encore servi :)\nVoici donc la liste des Ã©lÃ©ments utilisÃ©s pour la rÃ©alisation complÃ¨te :\n\nUn smartphone (Nexus S sous Android).\nUne carte Arduino (Uno).\nUn module Bluetooth (Sparkfun Bluetooth Mate Gold).\nUne diode Ã  infrarouge Ã©mettrice (CQY 89).\nUne carte Ã©lectronique conÃ§ue spÃ©cifiquement pour relier les diffÃ©rents\nÃ©lÃ©ments entre eux.\n\nÃ la dÃ©couverte du protocole NEC\nLe protocole de communication infrarouge utilisÃ© par ma tÃ©lÃ©vision et par mon\nhome cinema (tous deux de la marque Samsung) est celui dÃ©veloppÃ© par NEC. Il\nutilise des trames simples, composÃ©es d'une adresse codÃ©e sur 8 ou 16 bits selon\nla version du protocole ainsi que la commande Ã  transmettre codÃ©e sur 8 bits. Le\nnombre maximum de commandes distinctes est donc de 256 par appareil. Pour coder\nles 1 et les 0 logiques, il utilise une impulsion haute de 560 Âµs suivie par une\nimpulsion basse d'une durÃ©e qui dÃ©pend du bit Ã  transmettre. 560 Âµs pour un 0\nlogique ou 1.70 ms environ pour un 1 logique. Pour plus de dÃ©tails, vous pouvez\nvous rendre sur cette page.\nPour mener Ã  bien mon projet, j'avais besoin de rÃ©cupÃ©rer l'adresse de mes\ndiffÃ©rents appareils ainsi que le code des commandes Ã  transmettre pour pouvoir\nles reproduire depuis mon montage Ã©lectronique. Heureusement, j'ai la chance de\npossÃ©der un rÃ©cepteur infrarouge sur mon ordinateur portable. J'ai donc utilisÃ©\nl'utilitaire mode2 du projet LIRC pour rÃ©cupÃ©rer la durÃ©e des\nimpulsions gÃ©nÃ©rÃ©es par mes tÃ©lÃ©commandes et ainsi interprÃ©ter leur\nsignification. Pour accÃ©lÃ©rer ce travail rÃ©barbatif, j'ai Ã©crit trÃ¨s rapidement\nun petit script bash qui me retourne la valeur dÃ©cimale de la commande contenue\ndans la trame :\n\n    \n\nAvec ce script, j'ai balayÃ© l'ensemble des commandes utilisÃ©es par ma tÃ©lÃ©vision\net mon home cinema. Par exemple, pour allumer ma tÃ©lÃ©vision, la commande en\ndÃ©cimale est 153. Ã vous de faire pareil avec vos appareils !\nFaire le lien entre le bluetooth et l'infrarouge grÃ¢ce Ã  l'Arduino\nMaintenant que l'on connait comment le protocole NEC fonctionne, on peut\nl'implÃ©menter dans la carte Arduino pour transmettre les commandes infrarouges.\nLa rÃ©ception Bluetooth se fait via une liaison sÃ©rie entre le module Bluetooth\net la carte Arduino. Pour envoyer une commande via ce montage vers un appareil\ndistant utilisant l'infrarouge, il faut en premier lieu envoyer l'adresse du\ndestinataire puis la commande Ã  proprement parler. Toutes ces informations\ndoivent Ãªtre transmises en dÃ©cimale octet par octet sous forme d'une chaÃ®ne de\ncaractÃ¨res. Un octet est reprÃ©sentÃ© par 3 caractÃ¨res.\nPar exemple, pour allumer ma tÃ©lÃ©vision, je dois envoyer la chaÃ®ne 007007153.\nCes 9 caractÃ¨res reprÃ©sentent donc 3 octets. 007007 correspond aux 2 octets\nconstituant l'adresse de ma tÃ©lÃ©vision et 153 Ã  la commande d'allumage.\nVoici le code dÃ©veloppÃ© pour la carte Arduino (Ã  compiler avec le SDK officiel)\n:\n\n    \n\nLe montage final\nPour relier les diffÃ©rentes parties du montage final entre elles, j'ai rÃ©alisÃ©\nun shield Arduino grÃ¢ce au logiciel de CAO EAGLE PCB Software. Le gros\navantage de cette solution est qu'il devient trÃ¨s facile de monter/dÃ©monter les\ndiffÃ©rents composants de la rÃ©alisation Ã©tant donnÃ© que j'utilise des supports\npour toutes les connexions. Cela procure une certaine propretÃ© du montage. En\nvoici une photo :\n\nVous trouverez l'archive ZIP contenant le PCB du sheild Arduino au format EPS Ã \ncette adresse.\nL'application Android\nPour terminer ma rÃ©alisation, j'ai dÃ©veloppÃ© une application Android pour\npouvoir piloter le tout depuis mon smartphone et/ou ma tablette. Ce programme\nnÃ©cessite un certain nombre d'amÃ©liorations (il s'agit principalement d'un PoC\net non pas d'un logiciel achevÃ©) mais est parfaitement fonctionnel. Il a Ã©tÃ©\ntestÃ© sur mon Nexus S et sur le Nexus One de ma copine.\nVous trouverez l'APK et le code source de l'application Ã  cette\nadresse. Bien que dÃ©veloppÃ©e pour n'Ãªtre utilisÃ©e que pour\nma propre installation, vous pourrez vous en inspirer pour l'adapter Ã  votre\nmatÃ©riel.\nConclusion\nLa rÃ©alisation de ce projet m'a permis de m'investir un peu plus dans le domaine\nde la domotique. En effet, l'intÃ©rÃªt premier n'est pas seulement de pouvoir\npiloter mes appareils Ã  infrarouge depuis mon smartphone, mais depuis n'importe\nquel systÃ¨me informatique. En pratique, il est donc possible de perfectionner la\nrÃ©alisation en y rajoutant de la reconnaissance vocale, des tags RFID bien\nplacÃ©s dans l'appartement (mon Nexus S possÃ¨de un lecteur NFC), etc.\nAffaire Ã  suivre...\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/ir-remote-control-from-smartphone/","title":"TÃ©lÃ©commander sa tÃ©lÃ©vision et ses autres appareils Ã  infrarouge depuis son smartphone"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/latex-on-mediawiki-1-19-2/":{"body":"Cela faisait plusieurs jours que j'essayais de faire fonctionner l'extension\nMath de MediaWiki pour pouvoir afficher des Ã©quations mathÃ©matiques en\nLaTeX.

As it is\nwritten on its official website, Scapy can replace a majority\nof network tools such as nmap, hping and tcpdump.\nOne of the features offered by Scapy is to sniff the network packets passing\nthrough a computer's NIC. Below is a small example:\n\n    \n\nThis little sniffer displays the source and the destination of all packets\nhaving an IP layer:\n\nIt will continue to sniff network packets until it receives a keyboard\ninterruption (CTRL+C).\n\nNow, let's look at a new example:\n\n    \n\nThis piece of code does exactly the same thing as the previous one except that\nthis time the sniff function is executed inside a dedicated thread. Everything\nworks well with this new version except when it comes to stopping the sniffer:\n\nWhen CTRL+C is pressed, a SIGTERM signal is sent to the process executing\nthe Python script, triggering its exit routine. However, as said in the\nofficial documentation about signals, only the main thread\nreceives signals:\n\nPython signal handlers are always executed in the main Python thread, even if\nthe signal was received in another thread.\n\nAs a result, when CTRL+C is pressed, only the main thread raises a\nKeyboardInterrupt exception. The sniffing thread will continue its infinite\nsniffing loop, blocking at the same time the call of sniffer.join().\nSo, how can the sniffing thread be stopped if not by signals? Let's have a look\nat this next example:\n\n    \n\nAs you may have noticed, we are now using the stop_filter parameter in the\nsniff function call. This parameter expects to receive a function which will\nbe called after each new packet to evaluate if the sniffer should continue its\njob or not. An Event object named stop_sniffer is used for that purpose. It\nis set to true when the join method is called to stop the thread.\nIs this the end of the story? Not really...\n\nOne side effect remains. Because the should_stop_sniffer method is called only\nonce after each new packet, if it returns false, the sniffer will continue its\njob, going back to its infinite sniffing loop. This is why the sniffer stopped\none packet ahead of the keyboard interruption.\nA solution would be to force the sniffing thread to stop. As explained in the\nofficial documentation about threading, it is possible to\nflag a thread as a daemon thread for that purpose:\n\nA thread can be flagged as a âdaemon threadâ. The significance of this flag is\nthat the entire Python program exits when only daemon threads are left. The\ninitial value is inherited from the creating thread. The flag can be set\nthrough the daemon property or the daemon constructor argument.\n\nHowever, even if this solution would work, the thread won't release the\nresources it might hold:\n\nDaemon threads are abruptly stopped at shutdown. Their resources (such as open\nfiles, database transactions, etc.) may not be released properly. If you want\nyour threads to stop gracefully, make them non-daemonic and use a suitable\nsignalling mechanism such as an Event.\n\nThe sniff function uses a socket which is released just before exiting, after\nthe sniffing loop:\n\nTherefore, the solution I suggest is to open the socket outside the sniff\nfunction and to give it to this last one as parameter. Consequently, it would be\npossible to force-stop the sniffing thread while closing its socket properly:\n\n    \n\nEt voilÃ ! The sniffing thread now waits for 2 seconds after having received a\nkeyboard interrupt, letting the time to the sniff function to terminate its\njob by itself, after which the sniffing thread will be force-stopped and its\nsocket properly closed from the main thread.\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/python-sniffing-inside-thread/","title":"[Python] Sniffing inside a thread with Scapy"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/qubes-os-docker-storage/":{"body":"The Docker engine stores all image layers in /var/lib/docker by default, which\nis not compatible with Qubes OS' template system.

C'est un systÃ¨me dit \"Seat-Centric\", c'est Ã  dire que tout\nest contenu dans le siÃ¨ge (l'OS, mais aussi les mÃ©dias).

Le cÃ¢blage est le suivant :\n\nCommunication IÂ²C avec les capteurs\nLa datasheet de la carte ATAVRSBIN1 nous donne les\nadresses IÂ²C suivantes :\n\nAK8975 : 0x0C\nBMA-150 : 0x38\nITG-3200 : 0x68\n\nCÃ´tÃ© logiciel, j'ai utilisÃ© la bibliothÃ¨que Wire du projet Arduino.\nExemple avec le gyromÃ¨tre ITG-3200\nPlusieurs bibliothÃ¨ques pour Arduino sont disponibles afin de\ncommuniquer avec les diffÃ©rents circuits de la carte ATAVRSBIN1. Je ne vais donc\npas rÃ©inventer la roue mais plutÃ´t donner un exemple Ã  titre pÃ©dagogique sur\ncomment Ã©tablir la communication IÂ²C afin de rÃ©cupÃ©rer les valeurs qui nous\nintÃ©ressent. Pour cela, j'ai choisi de me concentrer sur le gyromÃ¨tre ITG-3200.\nLes registres internes contenant les valeurs retournÃ©es par les capteurs sont\ndonnÃ©es dans la datasheet sous forme du tableau suivant :\n\nChaque capteur retourne une valeur sur 16 bits codÃ©e en code complÃ©ment Ã  2.\nÃtant donnÃ© que la lecture se fait octet par octet sur un bus IÂ²C, il sera\nnÃ©cessaire d'utiliser des dÃ©calages par 8 pour reconstituer nos valeurs sur 16\nbits.\nNous allons rÃ©cupÃ©rer l'ensemble de ces valeurs d'un seul coup en lisant 8\noctets Ã  partir de l'adresse du premier registre, Ã  savoir 0x1B. La sÃ©quence de\n\"burst read\" utilisÃ©e pour lire plusieurs octets en une seule interrogation IÂ²C\nest la suivante :\n\nUne fois les valeurs rÃ©cupÃ©rÃ©es, il sera nÃ©cessaire d'effectuer quelques\nopÃ©rations mathÃ©matiques afin d'obtenir des unitÃ©s lisibles, Ã  savoir des Â°C\npour le capteur de tempÃ©rature et des degrÃ©s par seconde pour les trois axes du\ngyromÃ¨tre.\nEnfin, voici le code utilisÃ© pour cet exemple :\n\n    \n\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/test-atmel-atavrsbin1/","title":"Test de la carte de dÃ©veloppement Ã  capteurs inertiels ATAVRSBIN1 d'Atmel"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/update-grub-from-live-cdusb/":{"body":"Sur toutes les machines dont je dispose Ã  mon domicile, je n'ai installÃ© Windows\nque sur une seule d'entre elles en multiboot avec Ubuntu (et oui, il faut avouer\nqu'avoir un Windows sous la main est toujours utile malgrÃ© tout). Cependant, ce\nvilain petit canard m'a causÃ© quelques soucis lorsque j'ai rÃ©installÃ© mes\nsystÃ¨mes sur cet ordinateur (Ã  cause d'un changement de disque dur).\nEn effet, j'ai installÃ© Ubuntu avant Windows car je n'avais pas son disque de\nrÃ©installation Ã  ce moment lÃ  (prÃªtÃ© Ã  quelqu'un). J'ai donc laissÃ© 100 Go au\ndÃ©but de mon disque dur pour le futur Windows et installÃ© Ubuntu sur le reste de\nl'espace disponible. Lors de l'installation de Windows, ce dernier m'a Ã©crasÃ© le\nMBR (comme d'hab ...) mais j'avais prÃ©vu le coup, ayant installÃ© Grub\ndans le PBR (ou VBR) de ma partition. MalgrÃ© tout, Ubuntu refuse\nde dÃ©marrer (contrairement Ã  Windows, lancÃ© depuis un bootloader appelÃ©\nGAG installÃ© dans le MBR), une belle console de rÃ©cupÃ©ration Grub\nÃ  l'Ã©cran ...\n\nCe n'est qu'aprÃ¨s coup que j'ai compris le soucis : aprÃ¨s l'installation de\nWindows, l'ordre des partitions a changÃ© et Grub essaye de charger le noyau\nLinux depuis une mauvaise partition. Pour rÃ©gler ce problÃ¨me, il suffit de\nlancer la commande update-grub pour mettre Ã  jour la configuration de ce\ndernier. Seul soucis : comment lancer cette commande si on est pas dÃ©jÃ  sur le\nsystÃ¨me ?

Of course, not all of these\nproviders are equal in terms of quality of service, security or privacy. At the\ncontrary, some of them falsely claim to have a zero-log policy or to even\nprotect you from malicious actors.\nHaving said that, using a public VPN service is not necessarily a bad idea if\nyou choose it correctly. It's a matter of trust after all. Who do you trust the\nmost for keeping your traffic private, your ISP, or a carefully selected VPN\nprovider? (I said carefully here because you have a larger number of VPN\nproviders on the market than ISPs available where you live).\nIf you trust your VPN provider, you get in theory a higher degree of online\nprivacy by proxying your connections through it (even if, as of today, nothing\ncan fully replace Tor). But what about security? From a theoretical\nstandpoint once again, TLS is well enough to guarantee the security of your\nonline activity. And thanks to projects like Let's Encrypt, most\nwebsites are accessible via HTTPS these days.\n\nSo, using a VPN doesn't give you a better security? Well, in practice, it's not\nthat simple, and for one simple reason: there are lots of misconfigured web\nservers out there! And it is actually the reason I wanted to write this blog\npost. To be more precise, it is this Twitter\nthread which made\nme realise that even experienced information security people can miss this\npoint:\n\n\"Please stop with your misinformation campaign. VPNs are completely\nunnecessary to protect someone in this scenario, https works just fine.\"\n@SchmiegSophie\n\nSophie is right here, HTTPS works fine, but only when properly configured. As a\nmatter of fact, I use an online accounting web application called\nBullet for the needs of my company. When I try to log\ninto my Bullet account, here is what happens:\n\nAs you can see, I am redirected to an HTTP page, leaking the session cookie\nbecause it is not marked as Secure. I let the company\nknow about this security issue months ago but to this date, they still haven't\ntaken any actions to fix it, hence the public disclosure here.\nThis category of issues is unfortunately quite common. Just the other day, the\nsame thing happened to me once again on the Help Desk tool of a cloud provider\nspecialised in Healthcare Data Solutions (HDS). It goes without saying that\nimpersonating an account used to request actions on production systems is\nsomething not desired... If I were to be connected to a public Wi-Fi while\ntriggering one of those improper HTTP redirects, a malicious actor on the same\nnetwork could have stolen my session token, and indeed, tunnelling my network\ntraffic using a VPN is a way to prevent it.\nAnother less costly way to prevent your browser from leaking personal data,\nincluding session cookies, is to turn on the HTTPS-only mode of your web browser\nas I did with Firefox. The result is the one of the above\nscreenshot: Firefox warns you when plaintext data is about to be sent.\nTo conclude, the decision to use or not a VPN is yours, and my intention was\nsolely to help you weight the pros and cons on that matter. If you think a VPN\ncan fit your needs, I recommend Mullvad VPN (this is my personal\nopinion, not a sponsor) for the following main reasons: EU-based company,\ndiskless infrastructure, post-quantum\ncryptography, open-source software without trackers (and\nwritten in Rust!), supporting open-source projects such as Qubes\nOS, and transparent security audit\nreports.\n","id":"https://blog.skyplabs.net/posts/vpn-security-improper-http-redirects/","title":"VPN, Security and Improper HTTP Redirects"},"https://blog.skyplabs.net/publications/":{"body":"Blog Posts\n\n\"Parsing .DS_Store files with ZAP\", ZAP Blog, Sep. 08, 2023.\n\"How to use Git in a secure way\", Avatao Blog, Sep. 04,\n2018.
