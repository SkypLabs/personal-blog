        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think it is obvious to say that the security of your online payments is
critical if you don&#x27;t want to have an unpleasant surprise one day when checking
your account statement. That&#x27;s why most banks have added a two-step
authentification security process to their online payment system. That way, you
have to confirm your online payment with a one-time password sent via text
message or other method by your bank. However, not every website supports this
feature, leaving you defenceless if someone steals your credit card information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
